## 📖 What is MCP?

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard that enables AI assistants to safely interact with external tools and data sources. With PixelLab's MCP server, your AI assistant can generate pixel art characters, animations, and tilesets directly within your coding environment.

## 🔧 Manual Configuration

If you prefer manual setup, here's the basic configuration for any MCP client:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "pixellab": {
      "url": "https://api.pixellab.ai/mcp",
      "transport": "http",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Replace `YOUR_API_TOKEN` with your actual token from [PixelLab](https://www.pixellab.ai/vibe-coding).
